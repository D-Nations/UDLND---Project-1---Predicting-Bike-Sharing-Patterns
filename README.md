First neural network in the Deep Learning Nanodegree course by Udacity.  This was a relatively light introduction to the world of model architecture, but it was good practice getting some of the low-level math down in the my_answers.py file.  

The most difficult part of the project for me was figuring out the dimensions of the arrays and getting them into the correct format.
